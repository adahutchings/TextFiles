Short Answer

1. Why do programers use pseudocode?
	Pseudocode allows you to write an algorithm out before you write it in code. It is easy to read and non language specific. This makes it very useful for drafting things out before implementing them. 

2. If you run a pseudocode on your computer what would happen? 
	Nothing, pseudocode is not recognized as a computer language. 


Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
 
	INPUT first number
	INPUT second number
	IF first number is greater than second number
		Print first number 
	ELSE 
		print second

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

	SET count to 1
	WHILE count is less than 100
		ADD 1 to count
		PRINT count
	End WHILE
	
3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

	FUNCTION findName(name, phonebook)
		FOR each name in phonebook
			IF phonebook.name is equal to name
				PRINT name
			END IF
		END FOR
	END FUNCTION
	
	CALL
	 
4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice. 


	phonebook = [ Anderson, Barry, Childs, Donovan, Einstein, Franklin, Goose, Hamburg, Ingot, Jackson, Kyle, Lima, Morgan, Nicholas, Opal, Paulson, Quincey, Roosevelt, Seinfeld, Turner, Ulrich, Vern, Wilson, Xi, Young, Zander ]
	
	function findName(name, phonebook) {
		for( let i = 0; i < phonebook.length; i++){
			if(name === phonebook[I]){
				return name; 
			}
		}
	}

	console.log(findName('Barry', phonebook));
