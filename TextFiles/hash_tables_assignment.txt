Exercises:

1. What is a hash table?
	A data structure that uses an associative array that makes it easy to map keys to values. 

2. What is hashing?
	Hashing is when strings are converted to numerical index using hashing functions. 

3. How does a hash table store data?
	Hash tables are similar to arrays and have slots or buckets located at different indices. The hash code is generated by using a hashing function which converts the key. The hash code designates which index the values associated with those keys will be stored. 

4. How are has tables and objects different? 
	They are very similar but have slightly different intended uses. Objects are better equipped to store data that is static and of many different value types. Hash tables are better for data that is made up similarly formatted values that each have their own identifier.  


5. Determine whether you would use a hash table or an object to store each of the following pieces of data:
	- A list of pets and their unique names. : Hash Table
	- The name, age, and the birthday of your best friend : Object
	- The name and location of every company in a given city : Hash Table
	- All of the books checked out from a library by a particular individual : Object

6. Build a system that allows a sales associate to enter a customer's name, address, and phone number into the system and look up customers using their phone numbers. Store this information in a hash table. 




 

7. Build a system that allows a store owner to track their store's inventory using a hash table for storage.



8. Build a system that allows digital copies of newspapers to be entered and searched by a publisher and publication date. Use hash tables to store the necessary data.
