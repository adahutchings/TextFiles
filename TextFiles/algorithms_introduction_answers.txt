1. Using Proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:
- Making coffee

	SET waterInPot to True 


	SET waterTemp TO 100c
	IF waterTemp is less than 100c
		Leave water on stove
	END IF
	ELSE
		Remove water from stove
	END ELSE 
	
	IF coffee in filter EQUALS false
		ADD coffee to filter
	END IF

	IF coffee in filter EQUALS true AND waterTemp is equal to or greater than 100c
		WHILE waterInPot is true
			Pour water over coffee
		END WHILE
	END IF
	
	



- Washing dishes
	SET dishStack to number of dishes
	WHILE dishStack does not equal 0
		IF dishRinsed = false
			Rinse dish
			Wash dish
			Dry dish
		END IF
		ELSE
			Wash dish
			Dry dish
			
		END ELSE

	END WHILE
			


- A choice of your own - Getting dressed
	IF wearingPants IS EQUAL TO false
		IF wearing socks IS EQUAL TO false
			put on socks
		END IF

		Put on pants
		IF pantsAreTooBig IS EQUSL TO true
			Put on belt
		END IF
		SET wearingPants TO true
	END IF

	IF wearingShirt IS EQUAL TO false
		IF weather IS EQUAL TO cold
			Put on longSleeveShirt
		ELSE
			Put on shortSleeveShirt
		END IF
		
		SET wearingShirt TO true
	END IF

	IF wearingShirt AND wearingPants ARE EQUAL TO true
		Put on shoes
	END IF




2. As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g. Google's search algorithm. It doesn't need to be a tech example (suck as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your cases make them stand out? 
-McDonalds : Created an algorithm for producing the same burger over and over in a shorter amount of time with little extraneous movements. They modeled their whole business from the beginning to be extremely precise and efficient at producing their ideal product. This was so successful because not only did the time to get your food decrease dramatically, but the product always tasted the exact same way.  
-Facebook : Famous or infamous depending on how you look at it for creating algorithms that "better user experience" Some people recently have found these invasive or controversial. Their algorithm is designed to show you content that you would find the most appealing. 
-OKCupid : OKCupid developed an algorithm that is supposed to match you with similar users based off your profile entries and a series of questions that you can answer at will. The more questions the more information the algorithm has and the better it should be at matching you with an accurate match. Many people use OKCupid because they feel that the algorithm gives them better results than other dating sites. 

3. Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm. 
An efficient algorithm would achieve the desired results with the least amount of steps or effort. It would be able to be accurate and would always deliver the same results from the same input. It would be able to be used over and over for different inputs and still return correct outputs. An inefficient algorithm might be over complicated and have extraneous steps. It might also be slower to return the correct outputs or possibly would not return the correct outputs of different inputs.
