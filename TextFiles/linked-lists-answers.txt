1. What are some pros and cons of using linked lists instead of arrays?
	Linked lists don't require sequential data storage where arrays do. Arrays elements can be accessed at will where linked lists have to go through each node until they find the one called. 

2. Come up with a real world example of a linked list.
	In a scavenger hunt you have a list of things to get to the treasure, however you cannot skip the steps to find it. You have to follow the first clue to the second and the second the third and so on. 

Programming Questions

1. The Linked List push function should take a value, create a node, and add it to the end of a list. Below is a push function for a singly linked list. However, there is something wrong with it. Find the bug and fix the code.

LinkedList.prototype.push = function(element) {
     SET node = {
	value: element,
	next: null
}

     IF the head node does not exist {
	THEN SET head to node
	}
     ELSE {
	SET current node to head
	SET current.next to node.next
     }
}

2. Given an unsorted singly linked list, remove all duplicates from the linked list.

FUNCTION findDuplicate(headNode, item)
     SET tempNode to headNode
     WHILE tempNode exists AND NOT (tempNode.item = item)
	SET tempNode to temNode.next
     END WHILE
     RETURN tempNode
END FUNCTION	     

3. Given an unsorted singly linked list, reverse it.

FUNCTION reverse(headNode)

     SET currentNode to headNode
     SET nextNode to null
     SET previousNode to null

     WHILE currentNode does not equal null 
	SET nextNode to currentNode.next
	SET currentNode.next to previousNode
	SET previousNode to currentNode
	SET currentNode to nextNode
     END WHILE

     SET headNode to previousNode

END FUNCTION
